    GET-Viz, an open-source python library that implements a dashboard for visual exploration of social and economic 
    indicators.The dashboard allows the user to interactively explore multiple dimensions of 
    the data. In particular, GET-Viz proposes two main filtering dimensions: temporal, to select a specific time 
    instant; spatial, to select multiple countries. The selections can be combined to implement a comparative 
    exploration of the resulting time series. The dashboard shows the evolution of one or multiple indexes to be 
    analyzed. 

    #### Get the data using a set of predefined connectors
    [World Bank](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation) Api  are available at the moment, but we are planning to extend the work to the most famous API Connectors, such as:  [WHO](https://www.who.int/data), [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/), [UN](https://data.un.org/). You can contact us if you want to help.
    #### Load your own data
    Get the data using a personal csv file. It is necessary to have a set of data in tidy format. There are three rules which  make a dataset tidy: 

    1. Each variable must have its own column. 
    2. Each observation must have its own row. 
    3. Each value must have its own cell. Internally Get-Viz transforms data using Pandas and Geopandas to provide data in the desired format to be visualized by the library.
